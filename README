done so far:
  basic html: nav bar, board
  basic css: fonts, nav bar, board
  basic js: drops pieces when "DROP" is clicked, switches turns, checks for win conditions


future work:
  working nav links (where should these go to?)
  win screen
  modal with instructions on page load
  display of whose turn it is
  movement/animation using GSAP library to show pieces falling into the correct slots
  rebuild UI using REACT
  use node.js and express.js to add a server side
  use socket.io to make the game work with two players on different devices
    update page and game to implement this feature - let players choose whether to play on one computer or two
  login functionality for the game?
  implement database backend to keep stats on logged in players?
